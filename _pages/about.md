I'm a sensing design enginner at Apple, under Advanced Technology Group. <br>
I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford under [Bao Research Group](https://baogroup.stanford.edu), and joint fellow at [Stanford Human Performance Alliance](https://humanperformance.stanford.edu). 

I specialize in the co-development of integrated `hardware` and `artificial intelligence` for `wearable human-machine interfaces`, with a focus on VR/AR and healthcare applications.


<ul style="line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 2em;">
  <li>AI algorithms for time-series signal processing, enabling motion prediction and language translation from physiological signals</li>
  <li>Generative AI models that extrapolate sensory data to enhance and enrich wearable experiences in augmented environments</li>
  <li>Wearable system design for capturing high-precision motion, health, and language signals, including EMG, ECG, and strain sensors</li>
</ul>

Write your biography here. This is first page Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
