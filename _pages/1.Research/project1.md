### Generalizable Wearable Human-Computer Interface
This research demonstrates advanced gestural interface capabilities enabled by high-quality datasets collected from newly developed wearable sensors. It features co-developed AI models that adapt to multiple users and tasks with limited training data.

The model leverages Transformer-based Few-shot learning for multi-task interaction, showcasing keyboard-less virtual typing and object/gesture recognition [Nature Electronics, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-022-00888-7)
